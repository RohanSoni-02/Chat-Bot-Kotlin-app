For the custom app, I have created a Chat bot application.
Implemented user authentication - Login/Register/Logout with Firebase, full CRUD suite and a context menu. The application uses RecyclerView to display user as well as the bot messages. Error handling is also implemented for data input by the user. The application includes use of advanced components, such as fragments, view models and concurrency.

User can use commands to open google, search on the web, launch gallery, play a game of rock, paper and scissors, solve basic arithmetic problems, tell a joke, date and time.
