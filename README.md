custom-app-RohanSoni-02 created by GitHub Classroom
For the custom app, I have created a Chat bot application.
Implemented user authentication - Login/Register/Logout with Firebase
User can use commands to open google, search on the web, launch gallery, play a game of rock, paper and scissors, solve basic arithmetic problems and tell date and time.
